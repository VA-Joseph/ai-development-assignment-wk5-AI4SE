# Week 5 Assignment – AI Development Workflow  
**Course:** AI for Software Engineering  
**Theme:** *Understanding the AI Development Lifecycle*

This repository contains all deliverables for **Week 5** of the *AI for Software Engineering* course. The assignment applies the **AI Development Workflow** to a real-world healthcare problem, focusing on end-to-end implementation — from problem definition to ethical deployment and reflection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define and structure a real-world AI problem.
- Apply data sourcing, preprocessing, and modeling techniques.
- Address deployment challenges and ethical implications.
- Illustrate the entire workflow using diagrams and documentation.

## 📌 Assignment Breakdown

### 🔹 Part 1: Short Answer Questions (30 pts)
- **Problem Definition:**  
  Hypothetical AI problem, goals, KPI, and stakeholders.
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Data sources, bias, and preparation steps.
- **Modeling:**  
  Model selection, validation strategy, hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation & Deployment:**  
  Metrics, concept drift, and deployment challenge.

### 🔹 Part 2: Case Study – Hospital Readmission Risk (40 pts)
- Define project scope, stakeholders, and KPIs.
- Propose data strategy & ethical concerns.
- Build preprocessing pipeline and choose appropriate model.
- Present confusion matrix, precision, and recall.
- Outline deployment with regulatory compliance.
- Offer optimization strategy (e.g., overfitting control).

### 🔹 Part 3: Critical Thinking (20 pts)
- Explore how biased data could skew patient care outcomes.
- Discuss fairness strategy and interpretability trade-offs.
- Evaluate impact of limited resources on model choice.

### 🔹 Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 pts)
